- GreenFunction2.ipynb
  This is an IPython Notebook which contains interactive Python scripting
  using a web-browser.

  It may be opened by:
  
    jupyter notebook GreenFunction2.ipynb

  or, if you have an old IPython installation (pre 4.0):

    ipython notebook GreenFunction2.ipynb

  This notebook is much similar to the Mathematica notebook, in terms of use.


- Hancock_A.py, Hancock_C.py, Hancock_D.py, Hancock_F.py, Hancock_G.py
  REQUIRES sisl to be installed.

  These files implement the tight-binding model of graphene using
  various tight-binding parameter sets, both orthogonal and non-orthogonal
  variants.

  When running these:

    python Hancock_A.py

  they calculate the graphene band-structure and plot it using matplotlib.

  Note models A, C and D are using orthogonal tight-binding parameter sets,
  while F and G are non-orthogonal basis sets.

- Hancock_F_transport.py
  REQUIRES sisl to be installed.

  This file creates input for tbtrans to run a pristine graphene transport
  problem.
  It creates the input matrices for tbtrans and also creates the fdf file
  needed to calculate the transport properties of the tight-binding model.

- generic_functions.py
  These helper functions are heavily used in the GreenFunction2.ipynb
  notebook and it is a requirement for the working of the notebook.

  It implements the Sanchez self-energy calculation in Python.

  NOTE: This file is not intended to be runned separately.
