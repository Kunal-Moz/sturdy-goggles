# Pedagogical codes developed for computational physics and data analysis as a part of the course - Computational Physics in University at Buffalo
======
Contains modules developed for various problems on the topic of : 
* C++ and Python Routines : Array programming, Vectorization
* Data Aanlysis : Spectral analysis, Data fitting
* Data Science : K-Means clustering, Neural Networks, Regularization
* ODE and PDE solvers : problems explored on Maxwell's equations, Dynamical systems, Fluid Dynamics.
* Boudary Value Problems
* Monte Carlo methods : Ising model, Quantum Monte Carlo


This updates the now-deprecated project of [PHY410](https://github.com/rappoccio/PHY410) developed by Prof. Richard Gonsalves (and updated by Prof. Salvatore Rappoccio).
